# Crime-Project

Crime, Covid and Grandparents Group. 

Helpful resource to install GitHub, set up and use is [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) and some [lecture slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html#1) on how also from Grant McDermontt

Let me know if you have any questions about this! It can be kinda confusing at first but can be very useful for sharing this project on R.
