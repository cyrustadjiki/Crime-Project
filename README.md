# The Effect of COVID-19 on Domestic Crime
## An Analysis of School Closure and Mitigating Effects

This was a year long honors thesis research project analyzing school closure during COVID-19 and domestic crime. This was accomplished with Drew Guggeis, Alex Strehlke, Isabel Tapogna and I qulaifying us for Deparmental honors through the University of Oregon Department of Economics. This paper was supervised by Professor [Bill Harbaugh](https://harbaugh.uoregon.edu/)

    Abstract
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper we estimate the effect of school closures on various crimes with a focus on domestic and child abuse. Additionally, we estimate the effects of family composition variables on the response of these crimes to closures. We find that school closures had a significant effect on the frequency of in-home crime, including child abuse and domestic violence. We also discover that families with persons over 65 in the household, typically grandparents, are less likely to experience the observed crimes. This suggests that the pandemic had a major impact on families and that there are significant mitigating factors through this period.
